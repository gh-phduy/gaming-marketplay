          "One of the biggest differences is how the game handles Gotham itself. Older LEGO titles usually treated open worlds as oversized hubs filled with collectibles and side activities that blurred together after a while. Here, the city feels more structured. Roads, rooftops, and districts are designed around movement instead of just scale, which makes exploring Gotham far less repetitive.",
          "That change is where the Arkham influence becomes noticeable. Batman moves faster, rooftop navigation feels smoother, and stealth sections finally have enough mechanics to stay interesting beyond the first hour.",

          "There is still plenty to collect, but side content appears more naturally and missions are shorter and better paced. The game wastes less time between major story beats, which helps Gotham feel active without exhausting the player.",
